# voting-machine
i designed a Python-based voting system that includes age eligibility checks,
the ability to specify the number of candidates for a given election, vote counting, and the determination of the winning candidate. This voting system
streamlines the election process by ensuring that only eligible voters participate and provides a means to accurately count and declare the electionÂ results.
